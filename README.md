“Necessity is the mother of all inventions” is an adage that everyone is familiar. It is the need to make things better and easier that forces an individual to think about something new. It is the need for being different and disruptive in the market that creates this zeal and determination. An indomitable spirit called ‘Entrepreneurship’ whose flame is one lit never fades.

Entrepreneurship has been a bug which has smitten young and old these days. This entire concept has changed the notion of risk-taking. Fear of failure is no longer a dreaded phobia. Organizations like Flipkart and Snapdeal which transformed from Startups to Unicorns have been an inspiration to starters.
